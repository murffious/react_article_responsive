## Project: Web Developer Interview - Church of Jesus Christ

1. Create a Responsive Default Article page using ReactJs (Next.js and without using Bootstrap or similar CSS frameworks) based on mockups and API data found here https://interview-project-17987.herokuapp.com/web-developer-test
2. Retrieve Data from the API and bind it to your article pages
3. Add the routing to make your application dynamic.
4. Add the ability to expand the thumbnail video and auto play.

// Explain some design UI decisions

- since the mock up wasn't 100% clear to me that is was full width I decided to go off of what lds.org has looked like to me where these type of components don't actuallly take the full width of the screen. Hence the right padding of 45% Going to add a nav bar on side or top to fill in space maybe.
- notes - hooks ended up not being super great for SSR due to no window obj
